### The below points have been improved from the previous project:
1. We can now differentiate between Manager and Applicant signup. Earlier there was only a single signup option for both Manager and Applicant.
2. There can be multiple managers who can add now multiple jobs.
3. A single job application can have multiple applicants apply for it.
4. There is a search field through which the user can search for any particular job based on job name.
5. A Manager can either Accept/Reject a job application by the applicants.
6. This option is available only for the jobs the respective Manager posted.
7. A user can edit his/her profile information including changing user password. He can also add his skills in the profile.
