# WolfJobs
Need a side Hustle or want to get some quick rewards? Wolfjobs provides the perfect platform to meet your requirements.

A job portal which provides recruiters a platform to post temporary job openings and an oppurtunity for candidates to apply for the jobs without being concerned about permanent associations. 

# Why WolfJobs?
Unlike the Job Portals that display only Permanent job positions, WolfJob focuses on providing Temporary positions to anyone who wants to work for a limited period of time.

Be it a short-time Technical requirement or hiring a short-term Cashier for a dining place, WolfJobs covers it all! 
Every user associated with WolfJobs has a choice to Post a job or Apply for a job. WolfJobs provides a universal account for a specific user so that He/She can manage the applications as well as job postings efficiently!

Let's say that a Teaching Assistant is going on a vacation and needs a pair of hands to grade a particular exam having many students. He/She can post a requirement in WolfJobs stating the pay/rewards for the job. 
Let's assume the same Teaching Assistant has some free time and want to know if there are any temporary requirements for grading any other course. Thus, He/She can search the jobs in WolfJobs and apply for the same.

  1.	**Job Analysis** – In phase 3, wolf Job will provide the functionality of analysing various aspects of a job. Job Analysis based on various parameters using graphical representation will help in making prediction on which jobs are more preferred and for which jobs applicants have more inclination. Hiring managers can then decide what rewards and salary to be given to the applicants of that job. Even applicants will get to know, which job is being preferred among other applicants.

  2.	**OTP and Email Verification** – In the 3rd phase, wolf Job will provide the functionality to verify an end user by 2-way authentication, that is, Authentication via OTP as well as email verification.

  3.	**Chatbot Integration** – Our platform Wolf Job will also provide the functionality of Chatbot integrated with our website so that user can easily interact with the bot and get to know about various features of our web application and have a nice interactive experience.

  4.	**Interview Appointment Scheduling** – In future phase 3, Wolf Job will also provide the facility for the hiring manager to organize an interview appointment for the job based on applicant’s availability and convenient time uploaded by the hiring manager. Either of the users can upload their availability time in the G-sheet and using google calendar appointments can be organised.
