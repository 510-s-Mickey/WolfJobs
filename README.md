Job Analysis based on various parameters using graphical representation will help in making prediction on which jobs are more preferred and for which jobs applicants have more inclination. Hiring managers can then decide what rewards and salary to be given to the applicants of that job. Even applicants will get to know, which job is being preferred among other applicants.

2. **Chatbot Integration** ‚Äì Our platform Wolf Job will also provide the functionality of Chatbot integrated with our website so that user can easily interact with the bot and get to know about various features of our web application and have a nice interactive experience.

3. **Interview Appointment Scheduling** ‚Äì In future phase 3, Wolf Job will also provide the facility for the hiring manager to organize an interview appointment for the job based on applicant‚Äôs availability and convenient time uploaded by the hiring manager. Either of the users can upload their availability time in the G-sheet and using google calendar appointments can be organised.
