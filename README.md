# What's New

- Implemented new GitHub Actions are documented and described in the Wiki [here](https://github.com/SE-Fall-2024/WolfJobs/wiki/Github-Actions-Documentation).
- Containerization of Entire Application! This provides a seamless process to build the application.
- Minor changes to UI to match [style guide](https://www.figma.com/file/sqt0gh5H7bZEkryKZ9jFnK/WolfJobs).
- Implemented Prettier formating and EsLinting for style consistancy and static analysis
- Used In-Memory MongoDB databases to create a new MongoDB database in memory when testing the backend every time
- Fixed backend tests to no longer timeout and implemented a test suite of backend tests using ^



### Documented the application architecture in a software architecture diagram
![Diagram](https://github.com/SE-Fall-2024/WolfJobs/blob/8fc26401efe658c2fff36937a051a6430b69c36e/resources/Arch%20Diagram.png)

NOTE: Note about routes/v1/index.js step
From the backend/index.js file, it points to the /routers folder which contains an index.js file which points to another index.js which checks a user.js file for API endpoints, and then checks the final routes/api/v1/index.js and routes/api/v1/user.js. The different index.js files point to each other while checking the same level user.js files for API endpoints until it hits the routes/v1/user.js which contains the majority of the API endpoints. It took us awhile to figure this out and we wanted to document how it worked.

# Installation Instructions for Project Setup
<!-- Need to update this!! Especially if we dockerize -->

**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure that you have Node.js version 18.0 installed. If not, download and install it from [Node.js Official Website.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Download and install the latest version of MongoDB from [MongoDB Official Website.](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Make sure you have React version 18.0

**Step 1: Clone the Repository from this [link](https://github.com/SE-Fall-2024/WolfJobs)**

**Step 2: Prerequisites**
- Make sure [Docker]([url](https://www.docker.com/)) is downloaded.

# Future Improvements

**1. Email Service** - On getting selected/rejected to a job, the applicant should be getting an email about it.

**2. Interview Video Submission** - Managers can request applicants to submit a video screening file and applicants can upload a video on their side of the portal.

**3. Job Analysis** ‚Äì WolfJobs will provide the functionality of analysing various aspects of a job. Job Analysis based on various parameters using graphical representation will help in making prediction on which jobs are more preferred and for which jobs applicants have more inclination. Hiring managers can then decide what rewards and salary to be given to the applicants of that job. Even applicants will get to know, which job is being preferred among other applicants.

**4. Interview Appointment Scheduling** ‚Äì WolfJobs will also provide the facility for the hiring manager to organize an interview appointment for the job based on applicant‚Äôs availability and convenient time uploaded by the hiring manager. Either of the users can upload their availability time in the G-sheet and using google calendar appointments can be organised.

**5. Candidate Matching Percentage** ‚Äì WolfJobs applicant skill matching feature will include a percentage to how fit a candidate's skills are based on the job's required skills. Applicants will see a match percentage indicating how likely they are to get accepted and recieve an interview. 

**6. Matching based on Resume** ‚Äì WolfJobs applicants will be able to parse their resume and WolfJobs will extract key skills from the resume and compare it with required job skills to give candidates job matching status.

**7. Database Security and Hashing** ‚Äì WolfJobs currently does not securely store the password and user information in the database. This data needs to be protected and hashed to ensure security.

**8. Refactoring of Backend** - Reference the note attached to architecture diagram. There are multiple index.js files that reference eachother and should be consolidated.

**9. Fix Resume Storage and View** - Wolfjobs currently does not display resumes stored in the databases.
